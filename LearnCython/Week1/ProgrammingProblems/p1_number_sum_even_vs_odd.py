# Problem 1: Number Sum Even vs Odd
#
# Ask the user for a number, give them a quit option (say -1 to quit)
# Calculate the sum of all number from 1 to their input (1+2+3+...+n)
# Output the value and say if it is even or odd
#
# Example inputs and output:
#   n =  1 ->    1 is odd
#   n =  2 ->    3 is odd
#   n =  3 ->    6 is odd
#   n =  4 ->   10 is odd
#   n =  5 ->   15 is odd
#   n =  8 ->   36 is even
#   n = 25 ->  325 is odd
#   n = 75 -> 2850 is even
