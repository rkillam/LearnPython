# Problem 2: My List Class
#
# Write a class which will hold a list of items. The classes'
# constructor should take the maximum size of the list (note that
# Python lists are expandable, that is, they don't have a max length)
#
# This class will then have 2 methods
#   1: add, adds a given element to the list, but removes the first
#      element if there are too many in the list (queue)
#   2: has, looks through the list to see if a given item is there,
#      returns True if it is, False otherwise
#
# Then write a simple interface which allows the user to add elements
# to their list
#
# You haven't seen any examples of removing an item from a Python
# list. You should try to figure it out yourself (Google is your
# friend for all programming questions) but since that isn't and
# important part of the workshop you can ask me and I'll tell you.
